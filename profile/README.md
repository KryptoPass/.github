##  KryptoPass - Password Manager
KryptoPass is a robust password manager designed to protect your confidential data with high-level security,
whose name comes from the combination of "kryptós" (Greek for "secret") and "pass" (password).
This software gives you full control over the security of your passwords by allowing you to choose the encryption algorithm that best suits your needs,
either symmetric or asymmetric cryptography, being ideal for both advanced users and those who are just starting in the world of digital security.
